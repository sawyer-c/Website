# Personal Website 
###### By Sawyer Cowan
## CSCE 315 Project 1: Create your own website!

This is my first website created directly from HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Assigned by Professor McGuire, we are given the task to create our own website. This website is hosted on the people.tamu.edu servers at Texas A&M University.
### Project Goal
#### The goal of this project is to have a professional portfolio in place to share information about yourself.
#### The learning outcomes will be:
* A self-guided introduction to, ability to learn, or demonstration of your knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and / or JavaScript.
* Creating a Git repository for your files.
* Working in a development environment, but hosting on a server.
* Demonstrating the ability to transfer files between development environments and hosting environments.
* Controlling the initial impression of prospective employers, peers, etc.
* Providing constructive reviews to improve the quality of classmates’ work.

### Requirements - from Rubric.pdf
#### You will create and publish a web page on people.tamu.edu. The web page will contain the following:

* A landing page. This is the absolute first impression you want a prospective employer or client to see.

* An About Me page – displaying personal information you choose to share.

* A professional Image page – displaying technical information and resume. The resume is preferably in PDF format, but HTML is acceptable. Word or easily editable documents are not recommended. The resume should only be part of this page.

* A portfolio page. Linking to your GitHub account, a place for people to see what type of work you have done or will do in college or your career.

* A service page. Displaying your contribution to the community you serve.

* A minimum of 10 links to external web pages that are relevant to you and the work you are doing. This is not meant to be a page of “look at these links” but instead the links should be in appropriate places throughout your project to help you convey your message.

* A minimum of 300 words in the Professional Image page (NOT including your resume) and / or the Portfolio page describing your work and contribution to Computer Science. In the event that you have no contribution to computer science, this could be a the vision of your goals and aspirations for what you can bring to the field. Caution – you don’t want a prospective employer not taking you seriously.  (This is part of the writing requirements of the class. This will be peer-reviewed.)

* Navigation should be available on every page. Don’t rely on the back button.
