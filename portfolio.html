                    As a Computer Engineer at Texas A&M University, the plate we consume knowledge from, I consider, is wider than most other majors. I often think of the Computer-Electrical (CEEN) degree program as a buy-one-get-one major. At its present state, the degree plan requires about sixty percent major coursework to be Electrical-Computer (ECEN) courses and forty percent in the Computer Science courses (CSCE). While being in my 300 and 400 level courses for both departments, I have seen a wide spectrum regarding the inner workings of computer technology. This spectrum ranges from individual transistor and hardware design, and then phasing into software development and large computer networks.
