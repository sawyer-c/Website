            Helping the Community...

        </h3>

        <p>
            The world is very large. However, we cannot pretend everyone is on their own island. When we see someone drowning, we don't just scream for help, but we bring the help. Throughout my college career, I volunteer several hours a semester helping bag food and toiletries for the impoverished. The Bridge Ministries is a great food pantry in the Bryan – College Station (Texas) area. The Bridge, as it’s commonly called, runs on volunteers. As a member of Beta Upsilon Chi at Texas A&M University (which you can check out here), we band together to provide The Bridge the labor it needs to get the unemployed back on their feet.

            Another great opportunity Texas A&M has for community service is called The Big Event! Here’s a quote from the Big Event's page:
            <blockquote style="opacity: 80%; color: #500000"><em>"Through service-oriented activities, The Big Event promotes campus and community unity as students come together for one day to express their gratitude for the support from the surrounding community."</em></blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            My first Big Event day blew away my expectations. The people we served within the local community were very helpful and often provided snacks and plenty of water for the student workers.
