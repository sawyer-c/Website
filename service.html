        <p>
            The world is very large. However, we cannot pretend everyone is on their own island. When we see someone drowning, we don't just scream for help, but we bring the help. Throughout my college career, I volunteer several hours a semester helping bag food and toiletries for the impoverished. <a href="http://thebridgeministries.org/" target="_blank">The Bridge Ministries</a> is a great food pantry in the Bryan - College Station (Texas) area. The Bridge, as it's commonly called, runs on volunteers. As a member of Beta Upsilon Chi at Texas A&M University (which you can check out here), we band together to provide The Bridge the labor it needs to get the unemployed back on their feet.

            Another great opportunity Texas A&M has for community service is called <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">The Big Event</a>! Here's a quote from the Big Event's page:
            <blockquote style="opacity: 80%; color: #500000"><em>"Through service-oriented activities, The Big Event promotes campus and community unity as students come together for one day to express their gratitude for the support from the surrounding community."</em></blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            My first Big Event day blew away my expectations. The people we served within the local community were very helpful and often provided snacks and plenty of water for the student workers. The service, depending on the year and the area we worked on, mainly consisted of yard work: trimming bushes, mulching, and basic trash pickup. One year, a kind lady requested her kitchen be repainted. It took a few hours, but the sweet smile on the her face was worth the meticulous work.

            <a href="http://www.aggieislandparty.com/" target="_blank">Island Party</a> is an annual non-profit concert produced by the fraternity Beta Upsilon Chi. I have been a member of <a href="https://betaupsilonchi.org/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Beta Upsilon Chi" >BYX</abbr></a> for over three and a half years. I have seen what the power of this +300 organization can do for charity.
            Any and all net-profit from Island Party goes towards our philanthropy <a href="https://water.cc/" target="_blank">Living Water International</a>. The Living Water foundation builds wells for small villages in the more rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, <abbr title="Beta Upsilon Chi">BYX</abbr> of Texas A&M fully funded the entire cost of a well! Thousands of dollars went towards this amazing organization that not only brings water, but brings communities/villages of people together. Without the worry of dehydration, the villagers can focus on bettering their environments and work together for common goals. We often take our water access for granted. Living Water has continued to grow in size, and will continue to bring people together for years to come!<br>
